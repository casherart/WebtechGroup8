Toggle fucntion for overlay on maps

new menu entry in maps to add weather to form.














- FORM/URL Parameter in den SQL-Statements absichern (auch in den, die nicht von uns sind)
- User check for DB Querys

- JS-CHECK bei senden des Wetter-Forms

- is it possible in php to set global variable for db user and pw? The problem currently is that on funpic 
"root/root" is not allowed. And i don't want to make if else on every db connection.


?? User validation ??
